# dynamic_sharding_using_consistent_hashing
Here, I implemented dynamic database sharding using consistent hashing. But we can shard cache, server instead of database.

## 🧩 What is Consistent Hashing?

Imagine you have a **sharded database** (say 4 shards). Normally, you might use `hash(key) % num_shards` to decide where to store a user’s data.
But there’s a problem:

* If you add/remove a shard, **all keys get remapped** because `num_shards` changes. That’s very expensive.
* Consistent hashing solves this by arranging shards and keys on a **hash ring**.

### Key Ideas:

1. **Ring (0–2³²):** We treat the hash space as a circle.
2. **Shard placement:** Each shard gets placed on the circle at multiple points (called **virtual nodes**) to balance load.
3. **Key placement:** A key is hashed and mapped clockwise to the nearest shard.
4. **Minimal rehashing:** When a shard is added/removed, only nearby keys move, not all keys.
5. **virtual nodes:** minimize key shifting and balance load
6. **Replication:** Also, we can implement replication for high availability, distribute read and write (Instead of store data one shart we can store multiple shard clockwise.).

## 🔑 Key Points You Should Notice:

* **Virtual nodes (replicas):** Prevents imbalance when one shard gets too many keys.
* **Minimal remapping:** Adding/removing a shard only affects part of the ring.
* **Bisect module:** Efficiently finds the shard using binary search in `O(log N)`.

### 🛠 Raw Code vs Real-Life Systems

Our Python implementation is **a teaching/demo version**. In real distributed systems:

* You **don’t want every service to reimplement consistent hashing** from scratch.
* You need features like:

  * **Shard/node discovery** (who is in the cluster right now?)
  * **Failure detection** (what if a node dies?)
  * **Leader election** (who coordinates changes to the ring?)
  * **Automatic rebalancing** (when nodes are added/removed)
  * **Replication management**

That’s where tools like **ZooKeeper, etcd, or Consul** come in.

### 🧩 Role of ZooKeeper (and similar services)

* **Cluster coordination:** Keeps track of which nodes (shards/DBs) are alive.
* **Consistent view of the ring:** All clients can read the same shard mapping.
* **Automatic failover:** If a node disappears, ZooKeeper notifies clients to update their hash ring.
* **Used under the hood by many databases:**

  * Cassandra uses consistent hashing + ZooKeeper/its own gossip protocol.
  * Kafka used ZooKeeper (moving to KRaft now).
  * HBase also relies on ZooKeeper.

So yes — in **real life**, your app usually doesn’t “own” consistent hashing logic. Instead, a **distributed coordination service** manages it, and your app queries that service.

### 🔑 The Pattern:

1. **Consistent Hashing Algorithm:** Defines *how* keys map to shards (the theory we coded).
2. **Coordination Service (ZooKeeper/etcd/Consul):** Manages *which shards exist and are alive*.
3. **Your Application:** Uses library/client SDKs to look up shard placement instead of maintaining the ring itself.

👉 You’re spot on:

* **For a toy project:** raw code is fine.
* **For production at scale (Google, AWS, etc.):** rely on coordination services + proven libraries.
